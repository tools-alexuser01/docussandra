/**

 *
 * For test use only!
 *
 * The alternate strange reason for creating this is that it seems once our
 * RestExpress server is started up, it won't let go of the HyperExpress plugin
 * and will disallow another RestExpress instance to startup, even after the
 * first has been shutdown.
 *
 * Generally, the usage is as follows:
 * RestExpressManager.getManager().ensureRestExpressRunning();
